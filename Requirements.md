# Noodilicious

## 1. Vision
**Product Vision** - Guide consumers to the best choices available.

**Pain Point** - The noodle options are overwhelming.  This will guide consumers to the noodle product that matches them best.

**Why Care?** - We aim to provide suggestions to curious _noodlrs_.

## 2. Scope
- **In**  
  - allow users to add reviews for each kind of noodle.  
  - reviewers also have the option to update or delete their reviews.  
  - for the curious consumers, they can search for noodle information based on specific criteria, e.g country of origin, broth, flavors, etc  


- **Out** 
  - Noodlicious cannot provide medical advice.

## 3. MVP
- There will be 2 databases: the font end database will be for the reviews and the back end database will be for the noodle data.

- The front end can 
    - query the API
    - perform CRUD operations on the reviews database

- There will be a user interface


## 4. Stretch Goals
  - Include analytics based on the words that users have typed
  - provide analytics based noodle recommendations

  - Add admin functionality

  - Use captcha to check if the user is a human

## 5. Functional Requirements
- User can search for noodles based on search criteria

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
